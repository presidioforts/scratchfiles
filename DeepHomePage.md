## Overview

The **CIWAT SCP API Platform** is a centralized microservices solution designed to unify API management and integration across our core DevOps products.

### Supported CI/CD Products
- **EPL:** A CI system powered by Cloudbee Jenkins.
- **EPL-X:** A CI system leveraging GitHub Actions.
- **Harness:** A deployment platform for OpenShift container environments.

### Team Structure
The platform is managed by the **Platform Service Team**, consisting of:
- **Performance Team**: Focuses on API response time and system throughput.
- **Observability Team**: Ensures logging, monitoring, and alerting best practices.
- **Infrastructure Team**: Manages cloud resources and platform scalability.
- **Breakfix Team**: Handles incident resolution and quick remediation.

This document serves as a **single source of truth** for API operations, integration checks, troubleshooting, and platform performance standards.

## API Integration Mapping to CI/CD Workflow

This section maps **API endpoints** to specific CI/CD workflow stages, showing when each API is called and its expected outcome.

| CI/CD Stage  | API Endpoint | Purpose | Expected Outcome |
|-------------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **EPL (Build)** | `/validate` | Runs validation checks | Returns validation status |
| **EPL-X (Testing)** | `/run-tests` | Executes integration tests | Test results returned |
| **Harness (Deployment)** | `/deploy` | Deploys artifacts to OpenShift | Deployment success/failure |
| **Post-Deployment** | `/health` | Checks system health | Returns API health status |

> **Action:** Fill in this table with actual API endpoints used in each CI/CD stage.

---

## API Call Sequence in CI/CD Workflow

Below is a step-by-step breakdown of API calls within the **CI/CD pipeline**:

1. **Code Commit → EPL Stage**
   - [API] `/validate` → Runs static validation
   - [API] `/dependency-check` → Checks for dependency issues

2. **EPL-X Stage (Extended Testing)**
   - [API] `/run-tests` → Executes unit & integration tests
   - [API] `/security-scan` → Runs security vulnerability scans

3. **Harness Stage (Deployment)**
   - [API] `/deploy` → Deploys artifacts
   - [API] `/config-sync` → Ensures configuration consistency

4. **Post-Deployment Health Check**
   - [API] `/health` → Validates service readiness

> **Action:** Update this section with the **actual sequence of API calls** used in your platform.

## API Performance Monitoring

To ensure smooth CI/CD operations, API performance is monitored based on key **metrics**:

### Key API Metrics
| Metric | Description | Target Value |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Response Time (p95)** | Time taken for 95% of requests | < 200ms |
| **Error Rate** | Percentage of failed API calls | < 1% |
| **Throughput** | Number of requests per second | > 100 rps |

### Monitoring & Alerting
- APIs are monitored using **[Monitoring Tool]** (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
- Alerts are triggered when:
  - API response time exceeds **[Threshold]**.
  - API error rate surpasses **[Error Limit]**.
  - Unhealthy API endpoints persist for more than **X minutes**.

> **Action:** Specify actual metrics, monitoring tools, and alerting mechanisms used by your team.

## Observability & Logging

Observability ensures proactive issue detection using **logging, alerting, and tracing**.

### Logging Standards
- Logs are structured in **JSON format** for centralized logging.
- **Trace IDs** are used to track API requests across microservices.
- All logs are sent to **[Log Aggregator]** (e.g., ELK, CloudWatch).

### Alerts & Failure Handling
- **API failure alerts** are sent via **[Notification System]** (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack).
- **Automatic retries** occur for transient failures (e.g., API Gateway reattempts failed requests).
- **Escalation Policy:** If API downtime exceeds **X minutes**, escalate to **[Team]**.

> **Action:** Fill in details about logging, monitoring, and alerting.

---

## Resilience & Best Practices

### Stateless Microservice Design
- APIs follow **RESTful** principles and maintain **statelessness**.
- **Rate Limiting** prevents API abuse and throttling.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** prevents cascading failures in dependent services.

### Security & Compliance
- APIs are secured using **[Authentication Mechanism]** (e.g., OAuth2, API keys).
- All traffic is encrypted with **TLS 1.2+**.
- **Secrets Management:** Credentials are stored securely using **[Vault]**.

### API Versioning & Backward Compatibility
- **Current Version:** v1
- **Deprecation Policy:** Older API versions are supported for **X months** after a new release.

> **Action:** Specify security policies, versioning strategies, and compliance standards.

## Troubleshooting & Incident Management

### Common Issues & Resolutions
| Issue | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| API Latency High | Slow backend response | Check logs for query execution time |
| API Returning 500 Errors | Backend failure | Verify database & service availability |
| Deployment API Failing | Auth token expired | Rotate and reauthenticate |

### Incident Escalation Process
1. **Initial Diagnosis:** 
   - Review API logs in **[Logging Platform]**.
   - Check **status metrics** on **[Monitoring Dashboard]**.
  
2. **Triage & Escalation:**
   - **Low impact** → Assign to **Breakfix Team**.
   - **High impact (service down)** → Escalate to **Infrastructure Team**.

> **Action:** Customize with specific troubleshooting steps and escalation paths.

## SLA, SLO, and Operational Targets

### **Service Level Agreements (SLA)**
| Metric | Commitment |
|--------|-----------|
| **API Uptime** | 99.9% availability |
| **Response Time** | < 200ms per request |
| **Incident Resolution** | Critical issues resolved within 1 hour |

### **Service Level Objectives (SLO)**
- Maintain **99.99%** API reliability across all integrations.
- Ensure API **error rate stays below 0.5%**.

### **Operational Performance Targets (OPT)**
- **Response Time Thresholds:**
  - **p95 latency** under **200ms**.
  - **API call success rate** > **99.5%**.
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD):** Under **5 minutes** for API failures.

> **Action:** Define actual SLAs, SLOs, and OPT goals relevant to your platform.
