Got it! I will provide you with a structured format for your dataset (FAQ, user guides, runbooks) and an optimized fine-tuning approach for LLaMA 3.2 Instruct 1B on a CPU-based VM using LoRA or any potentially better method. Additionally, I will guide you on API integration for deployment and suggest general evaluation metrics suitable for an MVP phase. I'll update you once the details are ready.

# Fine-Tuning LLaMA 3.2 Instruct 1B for DevOps on CPU: A Structured Guide

## 1. Dataset Formatting
Preparing a well-structured dataset is crucial for effective training. Use a clear JSON format to separate user queries (issues) from responses (resolutions):
- **JSON Structure**: Represent the FAQ, user guide, or runbook entries as a list of JSON objects. Each object should have an **instruction** (the user’s question or problem description) and a **response** (the model’s answer or resolution) ([Best Way to fine tune Llama 3? - Beginners - Hugging Face Forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/best-way-to-fine-tune-llama-3/86724#:~:text=1,I%20personally%20recommend%20JSON%20format)). For example:  
  ```json
  [
    {
      "instruction": "How do I restart the payment microservice without downtime?",
      "response": "To restart the payment microservice with zero downtime, you should...\n1. Use the load balancer to drain traffic...\n2. Deploy the updated service instance...\n3. ..."
    },
    ...
  ]
  ```  
  This format clearly delineates the prompt and expected answer.
- **Optional Context**: If some entries require additional context (e.g. a log snippet or configuration), include an **input** field for that context ([GitHub - tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca: Code and documentation to train Stanford's Alpaca models, and generate the data.](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#:~:text=,text)). Otherwise, you can omit or leave `"input": ""` for most FAQ-style entries. The **instruction** should fully describe the issue or question, and the **response** contains the resolution or guidance.
- **Consistency and Clarity**: Ensure each example is self-contained and written in a consistent style. If runbook answers are typically step-by-step, format the responses as ordered lists or bullet points in the text so the model learns that style. Likewise, use a polite, professional tone appropriate for your FinTech DevOps context across all responses.
- **Quality over Quantity**: With only 10 examples, make them **diverse and high-quality**. Cover a range of typical issues to teach the model a variety of scenarios. Studies show that a small number of well-crafted instruction-response pairs can be surprisingly effective for aligning an LLM’s style and usefulness ([LIMIT: Less Is More for Instruction Tuning | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/limit-less-more-instruction-tuning#:~:text=finetune%E2%80%9D%20an%20LLM%3F)). So, ensure each JSON entry is accurate and representative of real queries – this will help the model generalize better despite the limited data.

## 2. Fine-Tuning Strategy
Given the CPU-based environment and small dataset, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach is ideal. The current strategy of using LoRA is well-suited, but we will optimize its settings and discuss alternatives:

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Continue using LoRA to fine-tune the model by **updating only small rank-specific weight matrices** rather than all 1B parameters. This drastically reduces memory and compute requirements. For example, using a LoRA rank of 8 and alpha of 16 (a common default) targets all linear layers with low-rank updates ([Fully Sharded Data Parallel](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/v0.10.0/en/accelerate/fsdp#:~:text=)). This means only a tiny fraction of weights (often <0.1% of the model parameters) are trained, resulting in an adapter file just a few megabytes in size (e.g. ~17 MB in one example for a 7B model) ([How to run Llama-2 on CPU after fine-tuning with LoRA | Oxen.ai](https://ghost.oxen.ai/how-to-run-llama-2-on-cpu-after-fine-tuning-with-lora/#:~:text=The%20final_checkpoint%20directory%20which%20should,bin%20file%20is%20only%2017mb)). The base model remains mostly frozen, preserving its general language ability while adapting to your DevOps Q&A domain.
  - *LoRA Hyperparameters*: For CPU training, using a modest rank (e.g. 4 or 8) is recommended to minimize memory overhead. A higher rank increases fine-tuning capacity but also the adapter size and RAM use. Start with rank=8, alpha=16, and a small LoRA dropout (around 0.1) to prevent overfitting ([Fully Sharded Data Parallel](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/v0.10.0/en/accelerate/fsdp#:~:text=)). These settings are a good balance for injecting your domain knowledge without requiring excessive resources. If memory is very limited, rank=4 can further cut the trainable parameter count at the cost of a bit less flexibility. 
- **Alternative Efficient Methods**: Consider **QLoRA** as an alternative if you need even greater efficiency. QLoRA finetunes LoRA adapters on a **4-bit quantized version of the base model**, massively reducing memory usage while maintaining nearly full 16-bit fine-tuning performance ([Making LLMs even more accessible with bitsandbytes, 4-bit quantization and QLoRA](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes#:~:text=,new%20data%20type%20that%20is)). In practice, QLoRA has enabled finetuning even 65B models on a single GPU by compressing weights to 4-bit and then applying LoRA updates. On CPU, QLoRA could reduce RAM requirements (since the model weights are 4-bit), but note that the current 4-bit optimizers (e.g. bitsandbytes) are primarily GPU-focused. If a CPU implementation is available or if you can offload some computations, QLoRA can be a powerful option to save memory ([Making LLMs even more accessible with bitsandbytes, 4-bit quantization and QLoRA](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes#:~:text=,new%20data%20type%20that%20is)). 
  - Other parameter-efficient tuning methods like **prefix tuning** or **adapter tuning** could be used, but they offer similar benefits as LoRA in reducing trainable parameters. LoRA is generally the most mature and effective for LLMs, so stick with it unless you have specific reasons to try others.
- **Avoid Full Fine-Tuning**: Full fine-tuning (updating all 1B weights) on CPU is not recommended – it would be extremely slow and memory-intensive. LoRA or similar approaches let you achieve the needed domain adaptation with a fraction of the resources. For context, even a 3B model typically needs ~16 GB RAM to train on CPU ([Finetune LoRA on CPU using llama.cpp](https://rentry.org/cpu-lora#:~:text=TL%3BDR%3A%20Only%20considering%20RAM%2C%2016,take%20MUCH%20longer%20to%20train)), whereas LoRA on a 1B model will comfortably fit in far less memory. By focusing on a lightweight adaptation, you minimize the risk of running out of RAM or thrashing the CPU with swaps.
- **Leverage Base Model Strengths**: Since LLaMA 3.2 Instruct is already an instruction-tuned model, leverage its existing capability. The fine-tuning should be done with a relatively **low learning rate** and careful settings to **nudge the model** toward your specific Q&A format, rather than drastically changing its behavior. The strategy is to teach it the **DevOps runbook style answers and facts** in your 10 examples, while preserving the general language understanding it already has. This gentle fine-tuning (sometimes called “alignment tuning”) with LoRA will efficiently imprint the new information.

## 3. Training Execution
Executing the fine-tuning on a CPU-only VM requires batching the process smartly and tuning hyperparameters for efficiency. Below is a step-by-step workflow, along with tips for optimizing performance on CPU:

### Training Steps
1. **Setup Environment**: Install the required libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers and PEFT (for LoRA). Make sure PyTorch is installed with CPU support. It’s a good idea to set environment variables like `OMP_NUM_THREADS` and `MKL_NUM_THREADS` to use multiple CPU cores for computation (this allows matrix operations to utilize all cores).
2. **Load Base Model and Tokenizer**: Load the pre-trained LLaMA 3.2 Instruct 1B model in memory in inference mode first. In code, this might look like:  
   ```python
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(base_model_name, device_map={"": "cpu"})
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model_name)
   ```  
   Use `device_map={"": "cpu"}` or `model.to("cpu")` to ensure the model is on CPU. If your CPU supports bfloat16 (AVX512), you can load with `torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16` to halve memory usage without losing much precision. Verify that the full model loads into RAM (for 1B parameters this should be on the order of a few GB).
3. **Prepare the Dataset**: Convert your JSON dataset into a format suitable for training. Since you have the data in JSON, you can read it and for each entry, concatenate the fields into a prompt-target pair. For example, for each item, you might form a training string like:  
   `"<instruction>\n### Response:\n<response>"` (if following the Alpaca prompt style ([GitHub - tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca: Code and documentation to train Stanford's Alpaca models, and generate the data.](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#:~:text=Below%20is%20an%20instruction%20that,that%20appropriately%20completes%20the%20request)) ([GitHub - tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca: Code and documentation to train Stanford's Alpaca models, and generate the data.](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#:~:text=Below%20is%20an%20instruction%20that,that%20appropriately%20completes%20the%20request))) or simply feed the `instruction` as input ids and expect the `response` as the label. A straightforward approach is to use the Hugging Face `datasets` library to create a Dataset object from your JSON and then use the `Trainer` API. Make sure to tokenize the data with the LLaMA tokenizer and set the labels appropriately for causal LM training (the responses are what the model should generate).
4. **Initialize LoRA**: Use PEFT to attach LoRA adapters to the model. For example, with 🤗 PEFT you can do:  
   ```python
   from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model
   lora_config = LoraConfig(r=8, lora_alpha=16, lora_dropout=0.05, target_modules=["q_proj","v_proj"])
   model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
   ```  
   This will wrap the model with LoRA adapters on the specified target modules (here Q and V projection matrices as an example, or use `"all"` linear layers based on your config). Targeting all linear layers often yields the best result for LLaMA model ([Fully Sharded Data Parallel](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/v0.10.0/en/accelerate/fsdp#:~:text=))】. The model’s parameters remain mostly frozen except these LoRA layers.
5. **Train in Batches**: Since the dataset is very small (10 samples), you can actually set a batch size of 1 or 2 without issue. If you had more data, you’d batch more, but here each sample can be processed individually. Use the Trainer or a custom training loop to iterate over the data for multiple epochs. Given 10 samples, to effectively learn them, you might train for many epochs (e.g. 20-50 epochs) so the model sees each example multiple times. However, monitor the loss: if it drops to near-zero quickly (indicating the model has essentially memorized the answers), you might stop earlier to avoid any chance of overfitting the style. Enable gradient accumulation if you want to simulate a larger batch (e.g., batch size 2 with accumulation 5 to make 10 examples per update) – though with 10 total, this is optional.
6. **Optimizer and Hyperparameters**: Use a standard optimizer like AdamW. Set a low learning rate, e.g. around **2e-5 to 5e-5**. The model only needs a slight nudging to incorporate the new Q&A pairs. A too-high learning rate on such a small dataset could cause the model to overwrite its knowledge in unstable ways. You can also use a learning rate **warm-up** for a few steps (since the dataset is tiny, even 10-20 warmup steps) to avoid any initial shock to the model. Weight decay can be set to 0 (since we are not too concerned with generalization given the narrow scope and small data). A slight **LoRA dropout** (as set in the config, e.g. 5-10%) will add regularization, which is helpful given the few examples – it reduces overfitting by randomly zeroing some adapter updates during training.
7. **Run Training**: Execute the training loop. On CPU, this will be slow per step, but with only 10 samples and a small model it’s manageable. Each forward/backward pass might take a couple of seconds, so a few hundred steps could run in minutes. Ensure you **save the adapter weights** after training (the Trainer will do this for you, resulting in an output directory with an `adapter_model.bin` and `adapter_config.json`). Monitor the process for CPU utilization – the process should use your CPU cores fully but not exhaust RAM. If you see swapping or memory issues, you may need to reduce batch size or sequence length.

### Hyperparameter Tuning and Considerations
- **Epochs vs. Learning Rate**: There is a trade-off between number of epochs and learning rate. For 10 data points, you’ll likely run many epochs. Using a smaller learning rate allows more epochs without diverging. If you use a higher learning rate, you might reduce the number of epochs. For instance, you could start with 5e-5 for 20 epochs and see if the model outputs correct answers; if not, you can increase epochs or LR slightly. Always verify the outputs on your training questions to ensure it learned them.
- **Sequence Length**: Set an appropriate maximum sequence length for training. Your use-case likely involves relatively short prompts (maybe a few sentences describing an issue) and medium-length answers (a few paragraphs or a list of steps). You can set `max_seq_length` (for prompt + answer together) to something like 512 tokens to cover most cases, instead of the model’s max of 2048. This avoids wasted computation on padding and speeds up training. Essentially, don't pad each example to 2048 if the actual content is far shorter.
- **Gradient Accumulation**: If you want to simulate a larger batch on CPU to stabilize training, you can accumulate gradients over multiple forward passes. For example, accumulate 4 mini-batches of size 1 before updating weights to effectively have batch size 4. This can help average out noise, though with only 10 examples, it's more about ensuring enough data per update. Monitor if this impacts training speed too much on CPU – you might find single-sample updates are fine.
- **Monitoring**: Since this is an MVP, you might not have a separate validation set. Use the training loss as a rough indicator. It should decrease and stabilize at a low value. More importantly, do spot-checks: after training, ask the model each of the 10 questions and see if it produces the expected answers. This manual evaluation is crucial given the tiny dataset (more on evaluation below).

### CPU Performance Optimizations
- **Use Multiple Cores**: Ensure the BLAS libraries are utilizing all CPU cores. PyTorch will do this by default in many cases, but you can explicitly set `torch.set_num_threads(n)` to your CPU core count. This helps matrix multiplications (which dominate LLM training) execute in parallel. On a VM with, say, 8 cores, this can significantly speed up each training step.
- **Memory Management**: Keep an eye on RAM usage. A 1B parameter model in 16-bit precision will consume roughly 2GB of RAM for the weights, plus some overhead. This is quite manageable on most servers. If you’re seeing high memory usage, double-check that you haven’t inadvertently loaded the model twice or that you aren’t storing large intermediate tensors. You can enable gradient checkpointing to trade compute for memory (it will recompute activations instead of storing them), but for a 1B model this likely isn’t necessary on CPU. 
- **Quantized Training (if possible)**: If an implementation allows, you could train with 8-bit or 4-bit precision for weights (as QLoRA does) to save memory. However, without GPU support this is tricky. It might be simpler to train in 16-bit or 32-bit on CPU and then use quantization for deployment. The key is that the adapter itself is small, so the bulk of memory use is the base model. Generally, 16 GB of RAM is sufficient to train models up to ~3B on CPU comfortabl ([Finetune LoRA on CPU using llama.cpp](https://rentry.org/cpu-lora#:~:text=TL%3BDR%3A%20Only%20considering%20RAM%2C%2016,take%20MUCH%20longer%20to%20train))】. For 1B, even a smaller VM (e.g. 8 GB) might suffice if using bfloat16. Just ensure swap is minimized to avoid slowdowns.
- **Batch Inference Testing**: You mentioned testing inference in batch mode – continue to use that to your advantage after each training run. You can script a quick batch inference of all training questions through the model to see how it performs. This can be done directly on CPU after each epoch if needed, to decide if further training is necessary.
- **Hardware Considerations**: If you find CPU training is unbearably slow, even for 1B, as a last resort you could use a smaller model (if available) or try to get temporary access to a GPU for fine-tuning and then bring the model back to CPU for deployment. But given the small data and LoRA, the CPU should handle it – just plan for the fine-tuning job to perhaps run for an hour or two in total depending on how many epochs you go for. This is usually acceptable in an enterprise prototype setting.

## 4. Deployment Strategy
Once the model is fine-tuned (with LoRA adapters), the next step is deploying it so that internal users or systems can query it via an API. The deployment should integrate the LoRA-adapted model into a runtime environment efficiently. Here’s how to proceed:

**1. Merge LoRA Weights (Optional but Recommended):** After fine-tuning, you have the base model and a set of LoRA adapter weights. You can either keep them separate or merge them for deployment. Merging will apply the learned LoRA deltas into the base model weights permanently. This results in a single model file that contains the combined knowledg ([How to run Llama-2 on CPU after fine-tuning with LoRA | Oxen.ai](https://ghost.oxen.ai/how-to-run-llama-2-on-cpu-after-fine-tuning-with-lora/#:~:text=Once%20you%20have%20finished%20training%2C,at%20the%20LoRA%20adapter%20weights))】. Merging is recommended for simplicity in production – it means you only need to load one set of weights. Tools like 🤗 PEFT make this easy: after training, call `model.merge_and_unload()` on your Peft model to bake in the LoRA chang ([How to run Llama-2 on CPU after fine-tuning with LoRA | Oxen.ai](https://ghost.oxen.ai/how-to-run-llama-2-on-cpu-after-fine-tuning-with-lora/#:~:text=base_model_name%20%3D%20%22meta,bfloat16))1】. The result will be a full model (still 1B parameters) that includes your fine-tuned knowledge. *Note:* The merged model will occupy the same size as the original (since you're essentially applying a patch to it), e.g. if the base was 4GB on disk, the merged model will be similar size. (The small 10-20MB adapter is now integrated.) If you prefer not to merge (say, to easily switch the model back to its original state or apply different adapters on the fly), you can also load the base model and then load the LoRA adapter weights at runtime – PEFT allows loading a model with `PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, adapter_path)`.

**2. Model Quantization for Inference:** For faster CPU inference, consider quantizing the model. Int8 quantization can cut memory use roughly in half and speed up computations at a slight cost to precision. You can use libraries like **Intel Deep Learning AMX (if on newer Intel CPUs)** or ONNX Runtime with quantization to get an 8-bit model. Alternatively, convert the model to a format like **GGML (GGUF)** for use with `llama.cpp` – this is highly optimized for CPU inference. In fact, tools exist to export the merged model to GGML and quantize to 4-bit or 8-bit for blazing-fast CPU respons ([How to run Llama-2 on CPU after fine-tuning with LoRA | Oxen.ai](https://ghost.oxen.ai/how-to-run-llama-2-on-cpu-after-fine-tuning-with-lora/#:~:text=research%2C%20and%20opens%20up%20many,laptop%20with%20relatively%20low%20latency))7】. Given this is an MVP, you might initially deploy in 16-bit or 32-bit for simplicity, but keep in mind that moving to 8-bit or 4-bit can greatly reduce latency and resource use if needed. For now, ensure the model fits in memory and that response time is acceptable; you can always optimize further with quantization in future iterations.

**3. API Integration – Loading the Model:** In your API server startup, load the fine-tuned model (merged or with adapter). This could be done using the Hugging Face Transformers pipeline or manually with the model’s `generate` function. For example, using the pipeline:
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path/to/merged-model", device_map={"": "cpu"})
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("path/to/merged-model")
   text_generator = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
   ```
   This will load the model on CPU and wrap it in a convenient interface. If you did not merge and instead have a LoRA adapter, load the base model then apply `PeftModel.from_pretrained` with your adapter path, similar to how you did during training. Either way, by the end of this step you should have a ready-to-use model object in memory. **Important**: Do this loading once at service startup and keep the model in memory (to avoid reloading for each request, which would be too slow).

**4. Building the API Endpoint:** Set up a lightweight web service using a framework like **FastAPI** or **Flask**. For example, with FastAPI:
   - Initialize the app and, in a global scope, have the model loaded as above.
   - Create an endpoint (e.g. a POST endpoint `/generate_answer`) that accepts a JSON payload with a user question or issue description.
   - In the request handler, take the question, format it as needed for the model (for an instruct model, you might not need much formatting – possibly just ensure it’s a complete sentence or add a prompt prefix like "`User: <question>\nAssistant:`" if the model was trained in a chat style). Then call the model to generate an answer. For instance:
     ```python
     prompt = request.json()["question"]
     output = text_generator(prompt, max_length=512, do_sample=False)
     answer = output[0]["generated_text"]
     ```
     Here we disable sampling to get a deterministic answer (or you can enable beam search for more controlled outputs). The model will produce the completion, which you then return in the API response.
   - Make sure to handle timeouts or long responses – since this is CPU, if a query triggers a very long answer, it could tie up the CPU. You might want to set a max tokens limit (e.g. 300 tokens) for the response to bound the processing time.
   - Also consider input validation: the model expects a textual question; you might reject or sanitize requests that are too long or not text.

**5. Testing and Scaling:** After deploying the API, test it with the known FAQ queries and some variations. Ensure the responses are correct and format is as expected (e.g. lists, paragraphs). At this stage, also test for concurrency if needed – a single CPU model can handle one request at a time efficiently, but if you expect multiple simultaneous requests, you might run multiple worker processes (each with its own model instance) or use an async queue to handle requests one by one. For an MVP in a FinTech enterprise environment, usage may be low enough that a single instance is fine initially. Just document that if usage grows, you’ll want to scale out (by running the service on multiple VMs or container replicas, each with the model) or explore model distillation for a smaller model.
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Plan how this API will be used. For example, if it’s internal, perhaps a chatbot frontend or a service that takes the user’s issue and returns the answer from the model. Ensure that the deployment abides by any enterprise policies (since it’s FinTech, data privacy is key – but since everything is on your servers and not calling external APIs, that’s a plus). Containerize the application (with Docker or similar) for consistency across dev/stage/prod if required. This makes it easier to deploy the CPU-based model service on your cloud or on-prem infrastructure.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement basic logging of requests and responses (while respecting privacy – no sensitive info) so you can monitor how the model is being used and what answers it gives. This will help in the next phase, evaluating quality and spotting any issues like hallucinations or errors in responses.

## 5. Evaluation Metrics for MVP
Evaluating an LLM fine-tune with only 10 examples requires a lightweight, mostly qualitative approach. You want to ensure the model is accurate, produces high-quality answers, and minimizes hallucinations. Here are suggested evaluation methods for your MVP:

- **Accuracy on Known Issues**: Since you have a set of known Q&A pairs (the training data), a simple accuracy check is to ask the model those same questions (or very slight variants) and see if it returns the correct resolution. Because the model has seen these during fine-tuning, it should answer them correctly. You can measure accuracy as the percentage of questions for which the model’s response contains the key resolution steps or information. This can be as straightforward as a checklist: for each of the 10 issues, did the model’s answer cover the expected solution? Given the small number, you can manually verify each. For a more automated metric, you could use a similarity score between the generated answer and the reference answer (such as ROUGE or BLEU), but with such short data, a manual check by a domain expert is more insightful. If 9/10 questions are answered correctly, you have 90% accuracy on the known set – a good start for an MVP.
- **Response Quality**: Evaluate the clarity, completeness, and style of the answers. Even if an answer is technically correct, it should be presented in a helpful manner (especially important for runbooks and guides). You can define a simple rubric for quality: e.g. **Relevance** (does it address the question asked?), **Clarity** (is it easy to understand and follow?), **Completeness** (does it fully resolve the issue or just partially?), and **Tone** (professional and user-friendly?). Each response can be scored on these aspects on, say, a 1-5 scale and then averaged. Since this is an early prototype, a lightweight approach is to have one or two DevOps team members review the answers and give subjective ratings. Look for things like: Are the steps in the resolution clearly delineated? Did the model omit an important step? Is there extraneous information or too much jargon? This qualitative feedback will guide you on where to improve the training data or the prompting style.
- **Hallucination Check**: Hallucination refers to the model inventing facts or steps that are not true or not present in your documentation. In a FinTech DevOps context, hallucinations can be dangerous (e.g., suggesting a command that doesn't exist or a step that could cause issues). To evaluate this, test the model with a few **unexpected or tricky questions**. For example, ask something outside the scope of the provided data, or slightly modify a known question to include a detail that the real runbook wouldn’t have. See if the model sticks to known info or starts guessing. Because the model was fine-tuned on only the given data, it might actually be less likely to hallucinate broadly – but it could still try to answer anything you ask (drawing on its original pre-training knowledge, which might not be accurate for your internal systems). If the model outputs an answer, verify each statement in it against your ground truth knowledge. One method is to deliberately ask a question where the correct answer is "unknown" or not in the docs, and see if the model admits it doesn’t know. If it instead fabricates an answer, that’s a hallucination. A possible lightweight metric: the **proportion of factual errors** in the responses. E.g., if out of 10 test queries (including some outside the training set) the model gave 2 responses containing made-up steps, you have a 20% hallucination rate. The goal is to minimize this. You can reduce hallucinations by instructing the model (via system prompt or fine-tuning) to say "I don't have information on that issue." when unsure. For MVP evaluation, simply note any instance of the model stating incorrect information that wasn’t in the training data.
- **Latency and Throughput (Bonus)**: While not explicitly asked, it's worth evaluating the performance in terms of speed, since this is a CPU deployment. Record the average time it takes to generate an answer (for a typical question length and answer length). This ensures the solution is practical for real-time use. If an answer takes, say, 5 seconds on average, that might be acceptable for an internal tool. If it’s 30 seconds, you may need to optimize or at least document this limitation. This isn't a metric of answer quality, but it's important for an MVP to be usable.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Treat this MVP evaluation as a baseline. Use the findings to plan next steps. For example, if accuracy on known questions is high but quality is lacking (maybe answers are too terse), you might enrich the responses in training or adjust prompting. If hallucination is observed on certain queries, you might add those cases to the fine-tuning data with correct answers (or explicit "I don't know" responses) in the next iteration. The evaluation at this stage should be lightweight – you likely won’t perform large-scale quantitative tests. Instead, focus on **spot-checking** and **gathering feedback**:
   - Have a small group of intended users (e.g. DevOps engineers) try the system and provide feedback on whether the answers are useful and correct.
   - Maintain a log of any mistakes the model makes (wrong answers or confusing phrasing) – this will directly inform how to improve the training data or the model in the future.
- **Metric Tracking**: Summarize your findings in simple terms: e.g., “On 10 known issues, the model solved 9 correctly (90% accuracy). Experts rated clarity an average 4/5. The model hallucinated in 1 out of 5 unseen queries. Average response time was 3 seconds.” These are easy-to-understand metrics for stakeholders reviewing the MVP. As you iterate, you can try to improve each of these numbers.

By focusing on these lightweight metrics, you ensure the prototype meets basic success criteria: it answers the FAQs correctly, in an appropriate manner, without glaring mistakes. This approach keeps the evaluation process efficient and manageable in a CPU-only, early-stage setting. As the project progresses, you can introduce more rigorous evaluations or larger test sets, but for now, this should give a clear picture of the model’s performance and areas to refine.
