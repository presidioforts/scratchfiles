### **Project: CIWAT SCP API Microservice Platform – Support Transition**

**Tasks Performed:**

1. Led the formation of the SME transition team in collaboration with Principal Engineers. Conducted architecture and design knowledge transfer (KT) sessions covering CIWAT platform components. Facilitated code walkthroughs for all 55 microservices, including DSOP, CI/CD Policy Services, EPL, EPL-X, and Harness APIs.
2. Performed in-depth analysis of systemic and performance issues across all APIs. Created and tracked defects, partnered with Engineering teams, and successfully stabilized Wave 1—comprising 10 essential services and 3 DSOP services.
3. Collaborated closely with Principal Engineers and Observability developers to define and document L1/L2 operational procedures. Created runbooks and established a sustainable support model for the CIWAT platform.
4. Successfully completed the support transition for 13 services, now fully managed by the Platform Services team.

**Next Steps:**
Transition work is in progress for the remaining 42 services.

**Status:**
