[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools==65.7.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"





You're right:

The build step logs show that pip3 install is being run without a setuptools version constraint.

As a result, it installs setuptools 58.1.0, which still has egg support partially broken and breaks setup.py install.

Fix Strategy 1: Force it via pyproject.toml

Yes â€” the modern way to enforce build-time dependencies is with a pyproject.toml. Here's how:

pyproject.toml (to be added in your repo root)

[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools==65.7.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

This ensures that any tool (including pip install ., python -m build, or Jenkins calling setup.py) uses setuptools==65.7.0 at build time.

> Note: pip install -e . and setup.py install will still bypass pyproject.toml. So, avoid those if possible.

Fix Strategy 2: Pin version explicitly before anything else installs

If modifying pyproject.toml is not an option right now, then add a pre-step in your Jenkinsfile/script:

pip install "setuptools==65.7.0" --upgrade

Do this before anything else runs (like pip install -r requirements.txt or other pip3 install).


---

Temporary Emergency Fix

In your current setup, where pip3 install is used in bulk:

Instead of trying to inject version pins into the cmd string,

You can prefix it like this:


pip install "setuptools==65.7.0" --upgrade && pip3 install ...

This way, it ensures the right version is in place before the main install.

Would you like help editing your pyproject.toml or Jenkins pipeline script to include this properly?
