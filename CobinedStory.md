Combined User Story 1: Enhance & Standardize Enterprise-Grade Dashboards

As an Observability Engineer
I want to review and enhance Bill’s existing dashboards for CIWAT SCP (focusing on the problematic Wave 1 services)
So that we provide an enterprise-standard view that includes improved metrics, visualizations, and integrated alerting for comprehensive monitoring

Acceptance Criteria

1. Dashboard Analysis & Design:

Review existing Grafana (and Splunk) dashboards and identify gaps.

Define new metrics and visualizations (e.g., latency percentiles, error breakdowns) that align with enterprise standards.



2. Enterprise Integration:

Migrate or build dashboards in the centralized enterprise Grafana instance.

Ensure dashboards provide comprehensive monitoring for the Wave 1 set of problematic services.



3. Alerting & Notifications:

Configure automated alerting for critical metrics (e.g., high error rates, latency spikes).

Integrate notifications with email, Microsoft Teams, and ServiceNow.



4. Stakeholder Access:

Ensure dashboards are accessible to all authorized enterprise users.

Provide basic training or documentation on using the dashboards.

Include step-by-step instructions for incident response.

Provide troubleshooting guides covering common issues.

Incorporate basic diagrams illustrating key workflows or system architecture specific to CIWAT SCP.
