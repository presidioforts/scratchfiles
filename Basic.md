1. Introduction

Kaniko is a tool that allows secure and scalable container image builds inside Kubernetes without requiring privileged access. This guide will cover everything engineers need to know to:

Set up Kaniko inside a Kubernetes Job.

Securely build and push images to a container registry.

Deploy and manage Kaniko builds in production Kubernetes clusters.



---

2. What is Kaniko?

Kaniko is an open-source tool developed by Google that allows building Docker images inside Kubernetes pods without requiring a Docker Daemon.

Why is Kaniko Important?

âœ… Daemonless Builds â€“ No need for a running Docker Daemon.
âœ… Runs as Non-Root User â€“ Avoids security risks.
âœ… Optimized for Kubernetes and CI/CD Pipelines.
âœ… Supports Private Registries and TLS Authentication.

3. Why Use Kaniko Instead of Docker?


---

4. How Kaniko Works in Kubernetes

Kaniko runs inside a Kubernetes Job, allowing builds without requiring privileged access.


---

5. Setting Up the Kaniko Kubernetes Job

5.1 Create the Kaniko Job YAML (kaniko-job.yaml)

apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: kaniko-build
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: kaniko
          image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest
          args:
            - --dockerfile=/workspace/Dockerfile
            - --destination=<YOUR_REGISTRY>/your-image:latest
            - --context=dir://workspace/
            - --verbosity=debug
      restartPolicy: Never


---

6. Deploying Kaniko in Kubernetes

6.1 Log in to Kubernetes Cluster

If using PKS (Pivotal Kubernetes Service):

pks login -a <PKS-API-URL> -u <USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD> --ca-cert <CERTIFICATE>
pks get-clusters
pks get-credentials <CLUSTER_NAME>

If using kubectl:

kubectl config use-context <CLUSTER_NAME>
kubectl get nodes  # Verify connectivity

6.2 Deploy the Kaniko Job

kubectl apply -f kaniko-job.yaml
kubectl get jobs  # Check job status


---

7. Monitoring and Troubleshooting

7.1 Check Job Status

kubectl get pods
kubectl logs -f <KANIKO_POD_NAME>

7.2 Common Issues & Fixes


---

8. Verifying and Deploying the Built Image

8.1 Verify Image in the Registry

docker pull <YOUR_REGISTRY>/your-image:latest

8.2 Deploy the Built Image

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: <YOUR_REGISTRY>/your-image:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080

Apply it:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl get pods


---

9. Cleaning Up Old Jobs

To remove completed jobs:

kubectl delete jobs --field-selector status.successful=1


---

10. Best Practices for Kaniko Builds

âœ… Use Multi-Stage Builds to reduce image size.
âœ… Leverage Layer Caching for faster builds.
âœ… Scan Images for Vulnerabilities using Trivy.
âœ… Ensure Proper Registry Authentication for secure access.


---

11. Conclusion

This document provides an end-to-end guide for:

Using Kaniko to build Docker images inside Kubernetes.

Deploying a Kubernetes Job to execute Kaniko securely.

Monitoring and troubleshooting builds.

Deploying the final containerized application in Kubernetes.
