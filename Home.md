## Overview

The **CIWAT SCP API Platform** is a centralized microservices solution designed to unify API management and integration across our core DevOps products. This platform plays a critical role in supporting and streamlining the following products:

- **EPL:** A CI system powered by Cloudbee Jenkins.
- **EPL-X:** A CI system leveraging GitHub Actions.
- **Harness:** A deployment platform for OpenShift container environments.

**Team Structure:**

The platform is managed by the Platform Service Team, which is segmented into four specialized groups:
- **Performance Team:** Focuses on throughput and response time optimization.
- **Observability Team:** Manages system monitoring, logging, and alerting.
- **Infrastructure Team:** Oversees hardware, cloud resources, and scalability.
- **Breakfix Team:** Handles incident resolution and rapid problem response.

This document serves as the single source of truth for operational procedures, maintenance activities, troubleshooting processes, and performance targets.

## Troubleshooting Runbook

For rapid incident resolution, this runbook outlines diagnostic procedures and escalation paths tailored to our integrated environment.

### Diagnostic Procedures
1. **Initial System Check:**
   - Review API performance metrics and system health dashboards.
   - Analyze log files for anomalies.
   - Confirm connectivity to EPL, EPL-X, and Harness.
2. **Integration-Specific Checks:**
   - **EPL (Cloudbee Jenkins):**  
     - Verify Jenkins job statuses and plugin configurations.
   - **EPL-X (GitHub Actions):**  
     - Check workflow run logs and validate authentication tokens.
   - **Harness (OpenShift):**  
     - Ensure container deployments are stable and resource allocations are optimal.

### Escalation Process
- **Immediate Resolution:**  
  - Attempt quick fixes based on initial diagnostics.
- **Team Escalation:**  
  - If unresolved, escalate to the respective teams:
    - **Performance Team:** For throughput or latency issues.
    - **Observability Team:** For monitoring and logging anomalies.
    - **Infrastructure Team:** For hardware or cloud resource issues.
    - **Breakfix Team:** For incident management and urgent remediation.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Log incidents and resolutions for future reference and process improvement.
