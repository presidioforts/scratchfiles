Subject: CIWAT Observability Cutover Sync â€“ Wave 1 Critical Alerting & Incident Workflow

Bill is planning to enable the observability alerting and incident ticketing feature for all Wave 1 CIWAT services, targeting critical alerts.

As Bill will be on PTO tomorrow and Monday, he has asked Scott and me to host this cutover sync meeting with the CIWAT API production support L1 and L2 platform service teams to:

Confirm readiness for go-live

Address any final questions or concerns

Ensure alignment on alert handling and ticket creation flow


This is a key step before the observability feature goes live in production.
