Subject: Issue in FilterConfig – Missing Request Handling after Forward Removal

Hi [Developer's Name],

I was reviewing the recent changes in FilterConfig, and I noticed a potential issue after the removal of .forward(...). Here are my observations:

1. Requests with a trailing slash (/) are adjusted but not properly handled.

Previously, the request was forwarded after trimming the slash, ensuring it reached the correct handler.

Now, the slash is removed, but nothing is done with the modified requestURI.



2. ALLOWED_PATHS check exists, but there's no defined request flow.

The check if (ALLOWED_PATHS.contains(requestURI)) remains, but without forward(...) or chain.doFilter(...), allowed requests are not processed.

This could result in unexpected behavior where valid API requests don’t get processed correctly.



3. Invalid paths are still blocked, but valid ones may not proceed.

The error response for invalid paths remains (SC_BAD_REQUEST), which is fine.

However, requests that match ALLOWED_PATHS might not be passed along to the next processing step.




Suggested Discussion Points:

What is the intended behavior after removing .forward(...)?

Should requests that pass ALLOWED_PATHS continue in the filter chain instead?

Do we need a check to allow /api/* requests instead of only /api?


Let me know your thoughts. I can help refine the approach based on the expected functionality.

Best,
[Your Name]
