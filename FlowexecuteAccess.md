Here's the corrected version with GITSAAS instead of GitHub Actions:


---

Tool: EPL-X GITSAAS

Summary: Requesting Access to Execute Workflows in Any LoB Organization

Description:
Platform service and operations engineers currently lack the ability to execute or re-run workflows across any LoB organization within GITSAAS, except for the non-production environment. This limitation impacts troubleshooting and support for EPL-X issues via ServiceDesk.

The request is not for write access but only for the ability to execute and re-run workflows for debugging purposes.

Product engineering has reviewed this issue and determined that a design story is needed to enable this capability without granting full repository write access.


Action Performed by Platform:

Identified the restriction and escalated the need for controlled execution access.

Verified that this is a GITSAAS product feature that requires a design update.


Action Performed by LoB/Product Engineering:

Reviewed the request with Sarada and the team.

Confirmed that a design implementation is required to allow execution rights without full write access.

Planning to define the necessary changes and implement them as a feature update.


Current Status: Awaiting Design Implementation by Product Engineering
Next Steps: Product Engineering team to create a design proposal and enable controlled workflow execution access.

Ready for the next issue.
