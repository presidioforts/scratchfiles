Below is a concise set of user stories capturing the core objectives and requirements we discussed. Feel free to refine the wording or acceptance criteria as needed for your specific team and workflow.

User Story 1: Analyze & Evaluate Existing Dashboards

As a member of the Observability Engineering Team
I want to review and evaluate Bill’s existing dashboards and metrics
So that I can understand the current state and identify what needs to be improved for an enterprise-standard solution

Acceptance Criteria

1. Access is granted to all existing dashboards (Grafana, Splunk, etc.) used for CIWAT SCP.


2. A brief assessment is created, detailing:

Current metrics and visualizations in use

Gaps, missing features, or suboptimal design elements



3. Recommendations are made for improvements to align with enterprise standards.

User Story 2: Develop Enterprise-Standard Dashboards

As a member of the Observability Engineering Team
I want to create (or enhance) dashboards in the centralized enterprise Grafana instance
So that stakeholders have a comprehensive, consistent view of CIWAT SCP’s critical microservices (Wave 1)

Acceptance Criteria

1. Dashboards incorporate new metrics and visuals beyond what Bill originally built (e.g., latency percentiles, error breakdowns, etc.).


2. Design follows “enterprise-standard” look and feel (per any existing guidelines).


3. Focus on problematic services in Wave 1, ensuring each has relevant metrics displayed (crash frequency, error codes, etc.).


4. Dashboards are accessible to authorized users in the enterprise Grafana platform.

User Story 3: Implement Alerting & Incident Integration

As a member of the Observability Engineering Team
I want to set up automated monitoring and alerting for CIWAT SCP’s dashboards
So that incidents are detected early and notified via email, Microsoft Teams channels, and ServiceNow

Acceptance Criteria

1. Alert thresholds are configured for critical metrics (e.g., high error rates, latency spikes, service crashes).


2. Notifications are routed to email, Microsoft Teams, and ServiceNow when thresholds are breached.


3. Alert policies are documented, including escalation paths and incident severity levels.

User Story 4: Create a Runbook & Troubleshooting Guide

As a member of the Observability Engineering Team
I want to produce a runbook with step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting guides, and basic diagrams
So that the product incident management and operations engineering teams can efficiently handle issues

Acceptance Criteria

1. A runbook is created specifically for CIWAT SCP (Wave 1 services), including:

Step-by-step incident response instructions

Common troubleshooting scenarios

Basic architectural or workflow diagrams



2. The runbook is made available in an accessible format (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint, etc.).


3. Teams are trained or have at least one walkthrough of the runbook contents.

Optional: General Notes / Future Enhancements

Further metrics or dashboards may be added upon additional discovery or changing business needs.

Outcome measurements (like MTTR, user feedback, etc.) may be defined collaboratively in future sprints.

This set of user stories is designed to cover the essential tasks: analyzing current dashboards, building enhanced “enterprise-grade” versions, implementing robust alerting, and creating a supporting runbook. You can present these stories to the Observability Engineering team as a starting point and iterate based on their feedback and your ongoing discovery.
