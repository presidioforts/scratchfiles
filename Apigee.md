Subject: Proxy Base Path Naming â€“ Update Needed

Hi [Developer's Name],

Please update the Proxy Base Path in the Apigee configuration to follow the expected format:

/domain-noun/subdomain-noun/unique-noun/version

For example:

/platform-assist/devops-ai/chatcompletion/1.0

The current path /devops-ai-assistant/chatCompletion doesn't meet this format and may be rejected during validation. Kindly adjust it to match the naming convention.

Let me know if you need help choosing the right values.

Thanks!
[Your Name]

Let me know if you want it tuned for tone (more formal/informal) or for Slack/Teams.
