Here's a concise, structured analysis and feedback of your evaluateSignedArtifacts method:


---

Analysis and Observations:

1. Nested Loops and Complexity:

Three nested loops (modules → artifacts → artifactsToSignArray) increase complexity and impact readability and maintainability.



2. Redundant Path Tokenization:

Path splitting logic repeated inside the innermost loop, causing unnecessary repeated computations.



3. Commented-out Error Handling:

Artifact existence checks are commented out. Lack of active checks could lead to silent failures or confusion during runtime.



4. String manipulation:

Multiple calls to .toString() and trim() are scattered, complicating the readability and possibly hiding performance issues.





---

Improvement Recommendations:

Simplify nested loops by clearly separating responsibilities:

First, prepare a set of artifact names from artifactsToSignArray.

Then, loop through artifacts once and match against this set.


Extract path handling logic into a helper method to avoid redundancy and improve clarity.

Reactivate and clearly handle errors to ensure clarity in the workflow.

Recommended Improved Code Snippet:

def evaluateSignedArtifacts(def buildInfo, def artifactsToSignArray) {
    def artifactIDMap = []
    def rtDetails = PipelineConfig.instance.rtfDetails
    def buildInfoModules = buildInfo.getModules()

    // Prepare artifact names set for quick lookup
    def artifactNamesToSign = artifactsToSignArray.collect { artifactPath ->
        extractArtifactName(artifactPath)
    }.toSet()

    for (module in buildInfoModules) {
        for (artifact in module.getArtifacts()) {
            if (artifact.getName() in artifactNamesToSign) {
                def artifactRemotePath = artifact.getRemotePath()
                def baseRemotePath = artifactRemotePath.substring(
                    0, artifactRemotePath.lastIndexOf("/") + 1
                ).trim()

                artifactRemotePath = "${rtDetails.rtfReleaseRepo}/${baseRemotePath}"

                def artifactPath = artifactsToSignArray.find { path ->
                    extractArtifactName(path) == artifact.getName()
                }

                def artifactsFound = wfS.findFiles(glob: "**/${artifactPath}")

                if (artifactsFound) {
                    evaluateArtifact(
                        artifact.getName(),
                        artifactPath,
                        artifactIDMap,
                        artifactRemotePath,
                        null
                    )
                } else {
                    wfS.error(
                        "No artifact named ${artifact.getName()} found in Jenkins workspace. " +
                        "Please ensure the artifact is present for signing."
                    )
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return artifactIDMap
}

def extractArtifactName(def artifactPath) {
    artifactPath.tokenize("/\\")[-1]
}

Benefits of the Suggested Approach:

Simplifies the logic by removing redundant tokenization and nested checks.

Improves readability and maintainability with clear helper functions and explicit error handling.

Reduces runtime complexity by optimizing artifact name lookups.


This refinement promotes robust workflow execution and simplifies debugging.
