**Subject:** Engineering AI Use Case – Code-Review Multi-Agents

Hello Satish,

Per our discussion, we’re concentrating on three AI initiatives this cycle—two for Platform Services and one for Product Engineering. Below is the final Engineering use case. Platform Service team can take responsibility deploy the multi-agent framework across all EPL, EPL-X, and CIWAT repositories.

### Product Engineering Use Case

EPL, EPL-X, and CIWAT teams lose significant time on manual debugging, refactoring, and legacy maintenance—delaying features and critical fixes. Embedding an AI-powered coding assistant in each repo automates these tasks, pinpoints root causes, performs bulk refactors, and accelerates code navigation and comprehension.

*We are not discussing Copilot.* The proposal is to run **code-review multi-agents** directly in the repository, executing automated reviews and highlighting product defects.

**Primary Users**

* **Product Owners & Developers** – Resolve issues faster and focus on high-value feature work.
* **SRE & DevOps Teams** – Cut downtime by quickly identifying root causes and applying immediate fixes.

**Business Impact**

* **Up to 55% faster development cycles** without quality loss
* **≈ 50% quicker bug fixes**, boosting service availability
* Lower MTTR, fewer change-related failures, and reduced technical debt—driving sustained product stability and reliability

Integrating these AI agents will reshape how we manage the product and deliver measurable uptime gains.

Let me know if you’d like any tweaks or additional detail.

Best,
\[Your Name]
