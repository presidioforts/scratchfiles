Got it — thanks for clarifying you’re talking about **EPL-X CI** (your GitHub Actions–based CI/CD product).
Let me refine the email draft so it explicitly ties to that context:

**Subject:** Proposal: Local MinIO Deployment on OpenShift for EPL-X CI Build Caching

Hi Team,

To reduce load on our enterprise HPOS S3, I propose deploying a local, S3-compatible object store inside our OpenShift cluster using **MinIO**. EPL-X CI pipelines currently push and pull caches (e.g., **`.m2` repos, Gradle caches, software dependencies**) from HPOS S3, which is creating scalability issues.

With this change, EPL-X CI will instead point to `local-s3` as its cache store. The approach is low-impact — no workflow logic changes, only swapping the S3 endpoint in pipeline configuration. HPOS S3 can still be used as a backup target if needed through async replication.

Initial setup:

```bash
oc new-project local-s3
helm repo add minio https://operator.min.io/
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install minio-operator minio/operator -n local-s3
```

**Benefits:**

* Keeps EPL-X CI cache traffic inside the cluster, reducing WAN and HPOS load.
* Minimal disruption to existing S3-based caching (endpoint swap only).
* Improves build speed by avoiding repeated external downloads.
* Mitigates **current HPOS S3 scalability issues** by offloading heavy CI cache workloads.
* Supports HA, versioning, and optional replication back to HPOS S3.

Please review this approach and share your feedback.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]

Do you want me to also draft a **sample EPL-X CI GitHub Actions workflow snippet** that shows how to set the cache endpoint to `local-s3` (so reviewers see how small the change really is)?
