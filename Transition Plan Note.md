In my current role as a Platform SRE and Subject Matter Expert (SME), I actively lead and collaborate on several critical activities to ensure platform reliability and operational effectiveness:

#### Detailed Current Responsibilities

* **Release Tag Analysis:**

  * Conduct bi-weekly and monthly release tag analyses specifically for the EPL-X, CIWAT, and EPL products.
  * Participate in walkthrough sessions hosted by engineering teams, reviewing release candidates, including newly developed features and resolved defects. These sessions help SMEs thoroughly understand feature development, testing processes, and identify potential defects early before customer exposure.

* **Operational Support and Escalation Management:**

  * Serve as a secondary escalation point after initial analysis by the Break-Fix team for customer-raised DevOps tickets, leveraging deep product expertise for effective triage and resolution.
  * Utilize insights from regular release analyses to respond promptly, reducing resolution time and minimizing customer impact.
  * Collaborate closely with Break-Fix leads to prevent escalations by proactively addressing potential blockers.

* **Team Synchronization and Communication:**

  * Coordinate daily 30-minute stand-up meetings across SMEs, Engineering, and Application teams situated in both India and the US, ensuring consistent alignment and rapid issue resolution.
  * Maintain an actively monitored team chat channel to provide immediate responses and continuous support to Break-Fix leads, facilitating smooth operations.

* **Training, Knowledge Sharing, and Documentation:**

  * Recently led EPL-X product and platform infrastructure training sessions for the Break-Fix team.
  * Currently conducting ongoing office hours designed to update teams regularly on emerging product features, defect resolutions, and operational best practices, ensuring up-to-date platform stability and readiness.

#### Ongoing Initiatives

* **CIWAT API Platform Support Transition:**

  * Actively collaborating with Bill and other SMEs to create comprehensive alert runbooks and detailed platform service documentation, supporting the handover from Engineering to Platform Service.
  * Completed onboarding for 10 services as part of Wave 1, with onboarding processes actively ongoing for an additional 35+ services.

I aim to maintain active participation in these collaborative SME activities as part of ongoing SRE efforts, preserving the effectiveness and alignment among SMEs, Engineering, and Break-Fix teams.

#### Planned Transition of my current Responsibilities

As part of my new role the following tasks will transition to Break-Fix leads:

* **DevOps Ticket Handling:**

  * Customer-initiated DevOps ticket handling, which previously escalated directly to me, will now be systematically routed to Break-Fix leads for initial triage and necessary resolution.

* **Documentation Maintenance:**

  * Responsibility for creating, updating, and maintaining FAQs and Break-Fix runbooks, based on recurrent issues and their resolutions, will transition to Break-Fix leads to centralize knowledge management effectively.

By transitioning these responsibilities, I expect to regain approximately 40% to 50% of my time. This newly available capacity will allow me to focus strategically on the following proposed objectives:

* Develop and enhance EPL-X and OCP Cloud Infrastructure for application migration and related platform activities.
* Optimize EPL-X infrastructure components, focusing on Objectstore improvements, Runner Kubernetes cluster sizing, and comprehensive infrastructure scaling to robustly support upcoming migrations.
