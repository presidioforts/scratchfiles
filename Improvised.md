Certainly! Below is the improved code that incorporates all the suggested features and corrections. I have made the following key changes:

1. Maintained Vectorizer Vocabulary: Updated the vectorizer to maintain a consistent vocabulary by fitting it on combined data.


2. Adjusted Label Encoding: Modified labels to start from 0 and ensured num_class matches the actual number of unique labels.


3. Retrained Model Instead of Incremental Training: Retrained the model with combined data to avoid issues with incremental training in LightGBM.


4. Used Dependency Injection: Eliminated global variables and used FastAPI's dependency injection to manage model and vectorizer instances.


5. Improved Exception Handling: Caught specific exceptions and provided meaningful error messages.


6. Handled Suggested Fixes Dynamically: Stored suggested fixes in a way that accommodates new error types.


7. Improved Data Management: Replaced mock data with a mechanism to load and persist data.

Explanation of Key Changes:

1. Maintained Vectorizer Vocabulary:

The vectorizer is now fitted on the combined dataset in train_new_model.

This ensures that the vocabulary remains consistent and includes all features from both old and new data.



2. Adjusted Label Encoding:

Labels are adjusted to start from 0 using data['label'] = data['label'].astype(int) - 1.

num_class is set based on the actual number of unique labels in the data.



3. Retrained Model Instead of Incremental Training:

The model is retrained entirely with the combined dataset in train_new_model.

This avoids complications associated with incremental training in LightGBM.



4. Used Dependency Injection:

The get_model_and_vectorizer function is used as a dependency to retrieve the model and vectorizer.

Global variables are eliminated in favor of function-scoped variables, improving thread safety.



5. Improved Exception Handling:

Specific exceptions are caught where appropriate.

Meaningful error messages are provided to the user.



6. Handled Suggested Fixes Dynamically:

Suggested fixes are stored in the data along with labels and log entries.

When predicting, the suggested fix is retrieved based on the predicted label.



7. Improved Data Management:

Data is loaded from and saved to data.pkl using the load_data and save_data functions.

This allows the application to persist data between restarts and maintain a consistent dataset.




Notes:

Thread Safety: The model_lock ensures that only one thread can access the model and vectorizer at a time, preventing race conditions.

Asynchronous Context: While model_lock helps with thread safety, if you plan to scale the application, consider using an asynchronous lock or other concurrency control mechanisms.

Persistent Storage: For a production environment, consider using a database to store data instead of pickle files.


Usage Example:

Training the Model:

POST /train
{
  "log_entries": ["ERROR: Unable to connect to database.", "WARNING: Deprecated API usage."],
  "labels": [4, 5],
  "suggested_fixes": ["Check database connection settings.", "Update the API usage to the latest version."]
}

Making a Prediction:

POST /predict
{
  "log_entry": "ERROR: Unable to connect to database."
}


Further Recommendations:

Input Validation: Implement more robust input validation to handle unexpected data formats.

Error Handling: Log stack traces for exceptions internally while returning user-friendly messages to the client.

Scalability: Consider using a model serving framework or containerization for better scalability and deployment.
