Tool: EPL-X IDP/Migration

Summary: EPL-X Migration Tool Not Effectively Converting cicd.yml to GitHub Actions Workflow Inputs

Description:
Developers migrating EPL applications from Enterprise Git to GitSaaS using the IDP/Migration tool are experiencing high build failure rates (80%) on the first commit, with only 15-20% snapshot build success.

Goal:

Fix gaps in the migration tool to ensure accurate conversion of cicd.yml to workflow inputs.

Improve tool reliability so that applications migrate smoothly without initial build failures.


Action Performed by Platform:

Identified inconsistencies in cicd.yml conversion.

Recommended enhancements to the IDP/Migration tool to improve conversion accuracy.


Action Performed by LoB/Product Engineering:

Required to implement fixes in the migration tool to ensure 100% accuracy in workflow input conversion.

Validate migration results post-fix to confirm successful first-time builds.


Current Status: Issue Identified / Fix Implementation Pending
Next Steps: Product Engineering to implement fixes and validate successful migrations.

Ready for the next issue.
