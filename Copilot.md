Subject: Copilot License Request for DevOps AI Assistant – Agentic Platform Service Automation Development

Hello Satish,

To accelerate development and deliver impactful biweekly demos, can we request Copilot licenses for the team?

We’ll be working with Python, ReactJS, and JavaScript. Copilot will help us move faster and deliver with more consistency.

We can identify and finalize the engineers who will be involved. One request—the engineers included could be those who bring creative thinking and are eager to deliver high-impact platform service agentic automation use cases. We can include them all in this Copilot request.

Our goal is to deliver 1–2 production-ready RAG use cases every two weeks.

Proposed team structure:

Applied ML Engineer – Builds embedding pipelines, integrates ChromaDB and LLMs, and develops FastAPI-based RAG APIs.

Data Science Engineer – Manages document ingestion, chunking strategies, and applies metadata tagging (e.g., versioning, deprecation) to structure the knowledge base.

Research Engineer – Prototypes deprecation classifiers, explores new prompting techniques, and improves model reasoning capabilities.

Evaluation & Safety Engineer – Designs hallucination tests, prompt regressions, and benchmarks for retrieval and generation quality.

Infrastructure Engineer – Hosts and scales Chroma/LLM services and sets up observability.


Let me know how you'd like to proceed. We’re aiming to finalize the setup this week and begin rapid iterations.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
