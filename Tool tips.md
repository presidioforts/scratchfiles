Perfect — tooltips are the right way to help devs/DevOps engineers choose quickly without overloading the dropdown.

Here’s how you can phrase them concisely (developer-friendly, no marketing fluff):


---

🔽 Dropdown with Tooltips

Dropdown options

Claude 3.7 Sonnet
Gemini 2.5 Pro
Gemini 2.5 Flash

Tooltips to show on hover/selection:

Claude 3.7 Sonnet → “Strong reasoning, ideal for Root Cause Analysis (RCA), complex troubleshooting, and long DevOps workflows.”

Gemini 2.5 Pro → “Balanced model for coding and DevOps automation; good mix of reasoning and performance.”

Gemini 2.5 Flash → “Fastest and most cost-efficient; great for quick CI/CD checks, log parsing, and boilerplate generation.”



---

👉 That way:

Users see short names in the dropdown.

On hover/hover-help, they get task-oriented guidance.


Do you want me to also prepare a longer expandable “?” info panel (like “Learn more about models”), or should we keep it only as quick tooltips?
