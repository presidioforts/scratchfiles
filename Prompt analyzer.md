Subject: Recommended Open-Source Packages for Prompt Analysis and Pipeline Routing

Hi Team,

As we explore building a scalable AI assistant architecture, I looked into open-source tools that can help us implement prompt-type detection, task routing, and multi-step pipelines (e.g., RAG, code generation, Markdown conversion, and agent actions).

Here are some options worth reviewing:

LangChain is a solid framework for routing, tool use, and RAG-based workflows. It includes components like RouterChain and AgentExecutor that let us define specific pipelines based on prompt intent. It's ideal for multi-modal tasks but can be a bit heavy.

Haystack by deepset is very effective for document Q&A and semantic search. It supports intent classification and sentence-transformer integration, which aligns well with our markdown-based documentation use cases.

LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index) offers a clean way to index and query structured content like Markdown and Confluence. It’s lightweight and integrates well with local LLMs.

Microsoft's Semantic Kernel provides a framework for orchestrating multiple “skills” like classification, summarization, and tool invocation. It’s designed with a more modular approach to planning and execution.

If we move toward more agent-based workflows (e.g., calling internal tools, executing scripts, answering from multiple models), options like CrewAI, AutoGen, and OpenAgents are worth exploring. They allow LLMs to reason over task delegation and execution through modular agents.

In short, these tools could significantly cut down our development time and let us focus on logic rather than building everything from scratch. I recommend each of us look into 1–2 of these frameworks and discuss what aligns best with our architecture goals.

Let me know your thoughts.

Best,
