Tool: EPLx

Summary: Classification of EPLx Non-Success Events (Errors vs Failures)

Description:
As part of enhancing monitoring and reporting capabilities, the non-success EPLx events must be clearly differentiated into 'Errors' and 'Failures'. The current EPLx approach incorrectly marks all non-success events under the status "Failure", diverging significantly from the EPL classification guidelines.

Application Issues: All events containing "END_USER" should be categorized as "Application".

Platform Issues: Events related to "WORKFLOW" and "DEPENDENCY" should be categorized under "Platform".


Proper classification is critical for accurately measuring SLAs, SLOs, Operational Targets (OTs), and effectively notifying responsible teams.

Action Performed by Platform:

Analyzed current EPLx event classifications.

Recommended adherence to EPL guidelinesâ€”using status "Error" for platform/product issues, and "Failure" exclusively for application issues.


Action Performed by LoB/Product Engineering:

Required to implement classification changes aligning with the standard EPL methodology.

Validate the correctness of event classifications post-implementation.


Current Status: Analysis Completed / Implementation Pending
Next Steps: Product Engineering team to implement classification alignment changes.
