The current implementation frequently sets validation statuses to null and later checks to reset them to empty strings or other defaults, which introduces complexity and potential risk of null pointer exceptions.

Current pattern:

crDetails.setCrValidationStatus(null);
// later in the code...
if (crDetails.getCrValidationStatus() == null) {
    crDetails.setCrValidationStatus(EMPTY_STRING);
}

Recommended improvement:
Directly initialize with a meaningful default and avoid repeated null checks, using a helper method like below:

// Define constants clearly
public static final String EMPTY_STRING = "";

// Helper method
private void initializeDefaultStatuses(CRDetails crDetails) {
    crDetails.setCrValidationStatus(EMPTY_STRING);
    crDetails.setCrWindowCheckStatus(EMPTY_STRING);
    // Set other default statuses
}

This approach simplifies your logic, improves readability, and significantly reduces risk of runtime errors.
