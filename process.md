**Subject:** Adoption of CR Release Standards for SCP Product  

Yes, SCP Engineering needs to follow these processes and CR release standards.  

We have already implemented this process and its steps for the EPL and EPL-X products. As a result, the EPL product now has a solid regression test suite in place, which successfully catches most critical defects before release.  

For the SCP product, Engineering will need to:  
1. Build a comprehensive regression and integration test suite covering all use cases.  
2. Publish test results well in advance of the CR date for review by the platform service team.  

This will ensure a robust and consistent release process across products while minimizing potential defects in production.
