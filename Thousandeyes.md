Subject: Importance of Both Availability and Health Checks for Comprehensive Observability

In observability, using both availability checks and health checks provides a more complete and resilient monitoring strategy, especially for enterprise-critical platforms.

Key Definitions:

1. Availability Check:

Purpose: Confirms if an endpoint (e.g., REST API, website) is reachable.

Focus: Monitors basic reachability and accessibility metrics, such as response time, DNS resolution, and packet loss.

Question Answered: “Is the endpoint accessible?”



2. Health Check:

Purpose: Evaluates the endpoint’s operational quality and performance.

Focus: Goes deeper than availability by validating functionality, tracking response codes, latency, and specific performance metrics.

Question Answered: “Is the endpoint operating correctly and performing as expected?”




Why Both Are Needed:

Availability checks provide a fast alert on reachability issues that can stem from network or DNS problems, even before a full health check might be triggered. They are crucial for detecting network-level outages quickly.

Health checks focus on operational quality, verifying that the service is not only reachable but also functioning as expected. This includes detecting slow responses, internal errors, or degraded performance.


Can Health Checks Replace Availability Checks?

While health checks often incorporate an availability component, they are not a replacement. Availability checks specifically capture network and reachability aspects that health checks might not fully address. In critical environments, both checks offer unique insights:

Availability Check: Early warning for network-level disruptions affecting end users.

Health Check: Assurance of consistent functionality and user experience.


Conclusion:

To build a resilient observability framework, both availability and health checks are essential. This ensures that not only is the endpoint reachable, but it is also functioning at the expected performance level.
