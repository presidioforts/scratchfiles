Splunk Incident Analysis: Event Sequence

1. Event Overview
Date: December 6
Log Source: ccwatt API service instance
File Path: apps/log/ccwatt/paaweb-JSON.log
Log Type: apache:access_web.json
Trigger: Splunk initiated monitoring under the WEB_LOG feature.


---

2. Incident Trigger
After December 6, no further logs were received from the ccwatt app_id service. This absence of data triggered BigPanda workflows, resulting in multiple incidents.

Note: The ccwatt app_id does not host any publicly accessible web application that would generate access logs.


---

3. Key Investigation Areas

Log Source Identification:
Determine which API service generated paaweb-JSON.log on December 6.

Deployment Verification:
Review recent deployments or code changes around December 6 that may have affected logging behavior.



---

4. Immediate Actions

Maintain Current Monitoring:
Do not disable Splunk monitoring for paaweb-JSON.log until the log source and its behavior are fully understood.

Next Steps:

Trace the responsible API service and review related deployment logs.

Verify logging configurations and confirm they align with expected service behavior.




---

5. Long-Term Resolution

Implement safeguards to prevent unintended or misleading logging.

Adjust monitoring configurations to align with validated logging sources, reducing the likelihood of false incident triggers.

This document provides a clear framework for ongoing investigation and ensures that monitoring continues until the issue is fully resolved. Please let me know if you need any additional refinements.
