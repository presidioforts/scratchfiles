Based on your description and the image provided, here's an approach to improve error categorization and achieve more insightful diagnostics:

Suggestions for Categorization Improvement:

1. Add Component-Level Categorization:

Introduce a column or tag to explicitly identify the failing component (e.g., "Build Tool," "Pipeline Configuration," "Dependency Management," etc.).

This provides a layer of granularity and avoids confusion between platform-level and application-level issues.



2. Contextual Metadata:

Attach metadata like stage of failure (e.g., "Build," "Scan," "Deploy").

Example: A CredentialNotFoundException might occur during a "Scan" or "Deploy" stage. This metadata helps pinpoint the error context faster.



3. Severity and Priority Levels:

Assign severity (e.g., "Critical," "High," "Medium," "Low") and priority based on the impact of the error.

Example: A "No space left on device" error might always be critical, but a "Unit test failure" may be medium unless tagged with "High priority."



4. Error Source Tagging:

Differentiate between internal errors (e.g., platform misconfiguration) and external errors (e.g., API or tool failures like ThreadFix or Trufflehog).

External errors might include network issues, API rate limits, or specific tool misconfigurations.



5. Machine Learning Assistance for Root Cause Analysis (RCA):

Leverage historical logs and patterns to auto-suggest likely causes or RCA for recurring errors.

Train the system on your error logs and associate common resolutions.



6. Dynamic Recommendations Based on Errors:

Include a recommendation field that populates potential next steps or resolutions based on the error code and category.




Framework for Categorization:

Here’s a structure to revise your categorization:

Immediate Actions:

1. Component Identification:

Clearly define whether a failed scan (e.g., TruffleHog, BlackDuck) falls under platform or application.

Scanning tools are typically platform-level but can involve application-specific configurations.



2. Refactor Code-Level Issues:

Separate build-time issues (e.g., compilation failures) from platform or orchestration errors.

Code-level issues should explicitly point to the source repository or code branch.



3. Create Cross-Mapping:

Build a mapping between errors and tools/services involved (e.g., "Error 2007" → TruffleHog scan).
