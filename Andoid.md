Subject: Android Build Issue – Gradle Build Stage Failures & Next Steps

Hi Team,

The checkout process takes around 20 minutes but completes successfully in all builds. While this increases total build time, it is not causing failures.

However, all builds are failing at the build stage during Gradle code compilation. The Android platform team is fully aware of these issues, and even last year, builds were unstable.

To move forward, the app team needs to define a plan and specify machine requirements. Once clear, the platform service team can assist with new hardware or any other necessary support.

I triggered a new build—checkout completed successfully, but it failed at the Gradle build stage.

Let me know how you’d like to proceed.

Best,
[Your Name]

This version keeps "build stage" and "Gradle" while ensuring clarity. Let me know if this works better!
