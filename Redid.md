Tool: EPL-X Redis

Summary: Redis Context Update Failing Due to Null group_id

Description:
The EPL-X Redis client is encountering failures while updating context due to a group_id value being null. This issue is observed in the redis-client-wrapper:set() function, causing errors when setting the key 12816699293, where the value remains undefined.

Action Performed by Platform:

Investigated Redis logs to confirm failure patterns.

Identified the issue in the redis-client-wrapper where group_id is not being properly assigned.

Provided insights on where the failure occurs in the JSON path.


Action Performed by LoB/Product Engineering:

Needs to ensure group_id is correctly populated before persisting data to Redis.

Review and apply fixes in the application logic to prevent null values from being stored.

Validate changes through testing and confirm resolution.


Current Status: Analysis Completed / Fix Required by Engineering
Next Steps: Product Engineering team to implement fixes and validate with test cases.
