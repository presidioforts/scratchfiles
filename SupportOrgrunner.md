Tool: EPL-X GitHub Actions

Summary: Required GitHub Actions Runner for EPLX Support Organization

Description:
The Platform Service team is currently unable to fork customer repositories into EPLX Support (https://github.com/wfgtitsas-EPLX-Support) and execute builds because no GitHub Actions runners are added to this organization.

Without a runner, builds cannot be executed, impacting support and troubleshooting capabilities.

A runner must be provisioned in the EPLX Support organization to enable workflow execution.


Action Performed by Platform:

Identified the missing runner as the primary blocker for executing builds in EPLX Support.

Requested provisioning of a GitHub Actions runner for this organization.


Action Performed by LoB/Product Engineering:

Required to add a runner to EPLX Support and ensure it is correctly configured.

Validate that builds can execute successfully after runner setup.


Current Status: Awaiting Runner Provisioning
Next Steps: Product Engineering team to provision and configure the GitHub Actions runner.
