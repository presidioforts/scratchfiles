Below is a revised user story that emphasizes APM as the core tool for API method-level monitoring while also outlining how Grafana and Splunk complement it for aggregated dashboards and log correlation.

User Story (Concise)

As an Observability Engineer,
I want to implement API method-level monitoring using our APM as the primary tool,
So that we can quickly detect, investigate, and resolve performance issues—including high-load usage patterns that spike CPU on our shared MongoDB cluster—by leveraging detailed transaction traces alongside aggregated dashboards and minimal logs.


---

Acceptance Criteria (High-Level)

1. Instrumentation with APM

Use APM to capture detailed, per-API method metrics (request rate, response time, error rates).

Ensure that each API method’s transactions are instrumented to generate unique correlation/transaction IDs that can be referenced elsewhere.



2. Complementary Dashboards & Aggregated Views (Grafana)

Build or update Grafana dashboards to provide an aggregated, high-level view of API performance metrics (e.g., top API calls by volume, latency trends, MongoDB CPU usage).

Use these dashboards as an initial alerting and monitoring layer to quickly identify anomalies.



3. Log Correlation & Context (Splunk)

Ensure minimal logging in Splunk includes the correlation/transaction IDs from APM for context.

Enable teams to drill down into logs via Splunk when APM identifies a problematic transaction, allowing for streamlined troubleshooting without incurring excessive log storage costs.



4. Documentation & Response Workflow

Update the incident management runbook to detail a unified workflow: start with Grafana for high-level monitoring, use APM for transaction-level insights, and consult Splunk for log correlation and context.

Train Operations and Incident teams on navigating this integrated toolset during performance incidents.

Questions

1. Integration Points:

How can we best leverage our existing APM, Grafana, and Splunk platforms to ensure seamless correlation (via transaction IDs) across the tools?



2. Data Retention & Granularity:

What are the optimal retention periods and sampling strategies for APM metrics and minimal logs to support both real-time troubleshooting and historical trend analysis?



3. Alert Thresholds:

Who should define and periodically review the alert thresholds (e.g., CPU usage, API call surges) detected in Grafana and triggered by APM data?



4. Rate-Limiting Policies:

Are there existing or planned rate-limit enforcement policies we can integrate into our monitoring and alerting strategy?



5. Workflow Validation:

How do we validate that the combined approach—APM for deep insights, Grafana for aggregated monitoring, and Splunk for context—is effective in reducing resolution times for high-load incidents?

This user story clearly states that while APM is the cornerstone for capturing method-level data, Grafana and Splunk play vital roles in providing an aggregated view and contextual logs, respectively. This integrated approach helps ensure that the entire monitoring and troubleshooting workflow is both comprehensive and efficient.
