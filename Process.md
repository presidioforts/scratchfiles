Certainly! Thank you for providing the additional point. Here's the updated and polished Release Management Process incorporating the new information:

Release Management Process for CR Changes

1. Data Required for CR Changes

Release Page

Maintain a comprehensive release page that lists all changes scheduled for production deployment. This ensures transparency and keeps all stakeholders informed about upcoming updates.


Test Results

Include regression and integration test results to validate the changes before deployment. This step is crucial for identifying potential issues that could affect the production environment.


Incident-Based Regression Tests

Convert every encountered incident into a corresponding set of regression test cases for inclusion in the next release. This proactive approach helps prevent recurring issues and enhances overall system reliability.



2. Observability Snapshots

Pre-Deployment Benchmark

The operations team will publish a snapshot of the current observability status before the Change Request (CR) is deployed. This serves as a benchmark for system performance and health.


Post-Deployment Monitoring

After 24 hours of deploying the CR, the operations team will capture another snapshot of the observability status to assess any changes or anomalies.


Deviation Handling

If there is any deviation from the benchmark, the engineering team must immediately investigate the issue. If necessary, the CR will be rolled back to maintain system stability.



3. Review Process

The operations team reviews the provided data and offers input to the PTASK engineer on whether the changes are ready for production deployment.

This review is a critical step to ensure the system's readiness and stability before any changes go live.


4. Scope

This process is already implemented for the EPL and EPL-X products.

The same process is now being extended to include the SCP product.


5. Engineering Responsibility

The operations team does not conduct code reviews or walkthroughs of the engineering team's changes.

Code reviews and walkthroughs remain the sole responsibility of the engineering team, ensuring that each team focuses on their areas of expertise.

Overall Assessment

Your release management process is comprehensive and emphasizes key practices essential for successful deployments. The addition of observability snapshots enhances system monitoring and ensures any issues are promptly addressed.

Strengths

Enhanced Monitoring

Incorporating pre- and post-deployment observability snapshots allows for effective tracking of system performance, making it easier to detect and address deviations quickly.


Proactive Quality Assurance

Including test results and converting incidents into regression tests demonstrate a strong commitment to continuous improvement and system reliability.


Clear Roles and Responsibilities

Clearly defining the responsibilities of the operations and engineering teams helps prevent overlap and confusion, promoting efficient workflows.



Recommendations for Enhanced Clarity

Accessible Documentation

Ensure all relevant documents (release page, test results, observability snapshots, regression tests) are easily accessible to team members, possibly through a centralized repository or collaboration platform.


Communication Protocols

Detail the communication channels and response timelines between the operations team and the engineering team, especially in the event of deviations that may require immediate attention or rollback.


Terminology Clarification

Provide definitions or a glossary for all acronyms and technical terms (e.g., CR, EPL, SCP, observability) in the documentation to assist new team members and prevent misunderstandings.
