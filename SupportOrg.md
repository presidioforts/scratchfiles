Here’s the revised backlog status report without the proposed solution:


---

Tool: EPL-X

Summary: Allow EPLX Support Org to Run Forked Repository Workflows

Description:
Currently, EPLX does not allow its support organization to execute jobs in forked repositories. In EPL, there is a feature where jobs under the DOE folder bypass SCM validation checks, allowing executions from the support org. A similar feature is required in EPLX to enable executions from EPLX Support.

The request is to allow execution of jobs from EPLX Support without SCM validation restrictions.

A workaround is needed to align with EPL’s approach while maintaining security and control.


Action Performed by Platform:

Identified the execution restriction for EPLX Support on forked repository workflows.

Suggested alignment with EPL’s approach to bypass SCM validation where necessary.


Action Performed by LoB/Product Engineering:

Review and decide on the best implementation approach.

Implement necessary changes to allow EPLX Support to execute forked repository workflows.


Current Status: Awaiting Decision on Implementation Approach
Next Steps: Product Engineering to finalize the design and implement the chosen solution.

Ready for the next issue.
