Summary:
Allow users to configure the default Git branch during onboarding in EPL-X (GitSaaS) using ELMA/IDP orchestration.

Details:
During application migration and onboarding via ELMA/IDP in EPL-X (GitSaaS), the "main" branch is automatically set as the default branch.
Currently, users do not have the ability to customize or change the default branch during onboarding.
This limitation affects teams that rely on alternate default branch naming conventions (e.g., master, dev, release).
We propose adding a feature that allows users to specify the desired default branch during the onboarding workflow, improving flexibility and alignment with existing enterprise Git standards.
