Below are the final versions of both stories without the additional questions, ready for JIRA:

Story 1: API Method-Level Monitoring and Correlation

User Story:
As a user, I want to implement API method-level monitoring using APM as the primary tool—with complementary Grafana dashboards and minimal Splunk logs—so that we can quickly detect, investigate, and resolve high-load usage patterns that spike CPU on the shared MongoDB cluster.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Instrumentation via APM:

Capture detailed per-API method metrics (request rate, response time, error rate).

Ensure transactions generate unique correlation IDs to support later correlation.



2. Aggregated Views with Grafana:

Build or update dashboards to display key metrics, such as top API calls by volume, latency trends, and MongoDB CPU usage.

Use these views for quick detection of performance anomalies.



3. Contextual Log Correlation with Splunk:

Implement minimal logging that includes the correlation IDs, enabling teams to correlate logs with APM data for targeted troubleshooting.

Ensure that Splunk logs provide enough context without incurring high storage costs.



4. Documentation & Training:

Update the runbook with the unified workflow: start with Grafana for alerts, use APM for deep transaction analysis, and consult Splunk for context.

Train teams on using this integrated toolset during high-load incidents.

Story 2: Forward ServiceNow Incident Emails to Team Channel

User Story:
As a user, I want ServiceNow incident emails to be forwarded to our designated team channel so that the relevant teams receive timely notifications and can act quickly on incidents.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Email Forwarding Setup:

Configure the ServiceNow workflow to forward incident emails to the team channel.

Ensure that all critical incident details and context are preserved in the forwarded messages.



2. Team Channel Integration:

Verify that the team channel receives incident emails promptly and that the message format is clear and actionable.

Identify and address any formatting or delivery issues during testing.



3. Testing & Feedback:

Test the forwarding process in a controlled environment before full production rollout.

Collect feedback from team members regarding the clarity and effectiveness of the notifications.



4. Documentation & Process Updates:

Update the incident management runbook to include the new notification process.

Provide guidance on how to monitor the team channel and handle cases when notifications are not received.
