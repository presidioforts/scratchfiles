For your presentation, your document should clearly explain **both the MCP server-based architecture** and the **UI/UX design** in a structured, executive-friendly format. Here's what to include:

---

### üìÑ Presentation Document Outline

---

#### 1. **Title Slide**

* **Title**: ‚ÄúDevOps AI Assistant for FinTech Enterprise ‚Äì MCP-Based Architecture & UI Design‚Äù
* Your name, date, team

---

#### 2. **Problem Statement**

* Manual DevOps troubleshooting is time-consuming
* Tribal knowledge, siloed product docs (EPL, EPL-X, Jenkins, Harness, OCP)
* Need faster root cause detection, fix, and collaboration

---

#### 3. **Solution Overview**

* AI-powered DevOps assistant with three core modes:

  * **Agent**: executes automation (restart, patch, scale)
  * **Think**: deep analytical insights
  * **Chat**: general-purpose LLM Q\&A
* Backed by centralized orchestration via **MCP Server**

---

#### 4. **MCP-Based Architecture Diagram**

‚û°Ô∏è Use the flowchart image we created (Frontend ‚Üí MCP ‚Üí LLM, Vector DB, Task Agents)

Explain:

* **Frontend**: handles user input & displays results
* **MCP Server**: intelligent router ‚Äî chooses the right model, DB, or automation agent
* **LLM**: multiple KB models per product
* **Vector DBs**: semantic RAG for EPL, EPL-X, Jenkins, etc.
* **Task Agents**: scripts or API triggers that execute real DevOps fixes

---

#### 5. **How It Works (Sequence Slide)**

**Example flow (Agent mode):**

1. User selects EPL-X + Agent + types ‚ÄúRunner stuck‚Äù
2. MCP loads EPL-X KB model
3. Queries Vector DB for past fixes
4. Matches fix pattern ‚Üí triggers `RestartRunner` agent
5. Returns logs + success state to user

---

#### 6. **UI Wireframe**

‚û°Ô∏è Use the latest mockup with:

* **Mode selector** (Agent, Think, Chat)
* **Component filter** (EPL, EPL-X, etc.)
* **Agent card** with action (e.g. Restart Runner)
* **Log output section**
* **Chat panel + Share/History tools**

---

#### 7. **Value Delivered**

| Benefit                   | Impact                                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Faster resolution         | 50‚Äì70% reduction in MTTR                |
| Tribal knowledge codified | No more engineer-dependency             |
| Scalable                  | New agents/models easy to plug into MCP |
| Audit and trace           | All fixes are logged centrally          |

---

#### 8. **Next Steps**

* Finish MCP POC
* Fine-tune KB models per product
* Build 3 high-impact agents: `RestartRunner`, `TraceFailure`, `Scaler`
* Roll out in test environments (EPL ‚Üí EPL-X ‚Üí Jenkins)

Would you like me to generate a clean slide deck or export this as formatted markdown for your doc?
