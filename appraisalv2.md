Project: CIWAT SCP API Microservice Platform – Support Transition

Tasks Performed:

1. Transition SME Team Formation:
Collaborated closely with Principal Engineers to establish the Subject Matter Expert (SME) transition team. Conducted comprehensive CIWAT architecture and design knowledge transfer (KT) sessions, partnering with Engineering to thoroughly document and explain component integrations across all services. Performed detailed code design reviews and walkthroughs for 55 services, including DSOP, CI/CD Policy Services, EPL, EPL-X, and Harness APIs.


2. Systemic and Performance Analysis:
Identified and analyzed systemic performance issues across all APIs. Initiated defect tracking, coordinated closely with Engineering to resolve critical defects, and successfully stabilized Wave 1, encompassing 10 essential platform services and 3 DSOP services.


3. Operationalization of Platform:
Worked collaboratively with Principal Engineers and Observability feature teams to develop comprehensive L1 and L2 runbooks. Successfully operationalized and transitioned the CIWAT SCP API platform to Platform Services, ensuring effective operational management.


4. Support Transition:
Completed the transition for 13 key services, which are now entirely managed by the Platform Services team, significantly enhancing operational stability and response effectiveness.



Project Status:

Successfully completed Wave 1 support transition over a duration exceeding six months.

Currently progressing through Wave 2, focusing on the transition of remaining services.


Feedback and Monitoring:

Consistently gathered detailed feedback from Platform Services teams to proactively address knowledge gaps and documentation deficiencies.

Organized targeted follow-up KT sessions to address identified knowledge gaps and updated runbooks to reflect current operational standards.

Established robust monitoring checkpoints in collaboration with Observability teams to ensure sustained service health and proactive incident management.

Continuously monitored incident trends and response effectiveness, refining L1/L2 operational workflows to enhance efficiency and reliability.

From an SRE perspective, achieved notable platform stability, evidenced by significantly reduced incidents related to API failures for consumer products including EPL, EPL-X, and Harness.

Project: EPL-X Product Training for Break-Fix and BAU Engineers

Tasks Performed:

1. Prepared comprehensive training materials and runbooks addressing current systemic issues, focused on effective break-fix incident management.


2. In collaboration with the SME team, set up reference training applications to simulate builds and deployments using the EPL-X and Harness platforms. Created onboarding documents to guide engineers through hands-on training.


3. Conducted bi-weekly, two-hour working sessions with multiple groups of engineers. Delivered hands-on onboarding training over a period of 2 to 3 months. Currently running office hours to address ongoing questions and support.


4. Collaborated with the JIRA Engineering team and SMEs to design and implement the SDLCDEVOPS intake form and configuration options.


5. Following approval from the Break-Fix team manager, the incident team has now begun taking ownership of break-fix tickets and actively working on resolutions.



Project Status:

Training sessions completed; office hours and support are ongoing.

Break-Fix team is now engaged in handling EPL-X incidents.




I've updated the duration as requested. Let me know if there's anything else!
