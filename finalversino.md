### Transition Plan Note

#### Hello Chandra, 
Thanks for setting up the meeting with Paul.  As discussed, as part of my new role, the following tasks will be transitioned to Break-Fix leads to streamline support operations and ensure clear ownership:

* **DevOps Ticket Handling:**
  Customer-initiated DevOps ticket handling, previously escalated directly to me, will now be systematically routed to Break-Fix leads for initial triage and necessary resolution.

* **Documentation Maintenance:**
  Responsibility for creating, updating, and maintaining FAQs and Break-Fix runbooks—based on recurrent issues and resolutions—will transition to Break-Fix leads to centralize knowledge management.

These transitions will free up approximately **40% to 50%** of my current workload, enabling me to strategically focus on the following proposed objectives:

* Collaborate with Engineering to enhance EPL-X product OCP Cloud Infrastructure for application migration and related platform activities.
* Optimize EPL-X infrastructure components, focusing on Objectstore improvements, Runner Kubernetes cluster sizing, and comprehensive infrastructure scaling to support upcoming migrations.

#### Current Responsibilities (to be continued)

In my current role as a **Platform SRE and Subject Matter Expert (SME)**, I actively lead and collaborate on several critical activities to ensure product and platform stability and effectiveness:

* **Release Tag Analysis:**

  * Conduct bi-weekly and monthly release tag analyses specifically for the EPL-X, CIWAT, and EPL products.
  * Participate in walkthrough sessions hosted by engineering teams, reviewing release candidates including newly developed features and resolved defects. These sessions help SMEs understand feature development, testing processes, and identify potential defects early—before customer exposure.

* **Product Support and Escalation Management:**

  * Serve as a secondary escalation point after initial analysis by the Break-Fix team for customer-raised DevOps tickets.
  * Leverage release insights to respond promptly, reducing resolution time and minimizing customer impact.
  * Collaborate closely with Break-Fix leads to proactively address blockers and prevent escalations.

* **Team Synchronization and Communication:**

  * Coordinate daily 30-minute stand-up meetings with SMEs located in both India and the US to ensure consistent alignment and rapid issue resolution.
  * Maintain an actively monitored team chat channel to provide immediate responses and continuous support to Break-Fix leads.

* **Training, Knowledge Sharing, and Documentation:**

  * Recently led EPL-X product and platform infrastructure training sessions for the Break-Fix team.
  * Currently conducting ongoing office hours to update teams on emerging product features, defect resolutions, and best practices—ensuring continued platform stability and readiness.

#### Ongoing Initiatives

* **CIWAT API Platform Support Transition:**

  * Collaborating with Bill and other SMEs to create comprehensive alert runbooks and platform service documentation, supporting the handover from Engineering to Platform Service.
  * Completed onboarding for 10 services as part of Wave 1, with onboarding processes actively ongoing for an additional 35+ services.

I intend to maintain active participation in these collaborative SME activities as part of my new role in SRE efforts. This will preserve the effectiveness and alignment among SMEs, Engineering, and Break-Fix teams.
