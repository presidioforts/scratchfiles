Narrative Summary

Overview:
On December 6, Splunk monitoring detected logs from the ccwatt API service instance (paaweb-JSON.log). Following that date, no further logs were recorded. This absence triggered BigPanda workflows, ultimately creating multiple incidents. Notably, the ccwatt application does not run a publicly accessible web service, which raises questions about why these logs appeared in the first place.

Key Investigations:

1. Log Source Identification: Determine which API service generated the paaweb-JSON.log entries on December 6.


2. Deployment Checks: Review recent deployments or code changes around December 6 that could have influenced the logging behavior.



Immediate Actions:

Continue monitoring paaweb-JSON.log to avoid losing critical evidence.

Trace the associated API services and inspect their deployment logs.

Verify that logging configurations match the intended setup and do not produce unexpected entries.


Long-Term Solutions:

Implement controls to prevent logging misconfigurations.

Align monitoring workflows and alert triggers with verified service configurations to reduce the occurrence of false-positive incidents.


This structured approach clarifies the situation, outlines immediate and long-term actions, and provides a pathway for resolving the underlying issue.
