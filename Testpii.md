Here is your updated document with clear, developer-focused notes explaining that the RecognizerResult does not contain the original entity value, and you must extract the value from the original text using the provided indices. This section is marked as critical for DevOps or workflow automation where replacements must be precise and robust.

ðŸ“˜ Learning Presidio Analyzer and Anonymizer with PII Restoration


---

ðŸ”¹ 1. Understand What Presidio Is

Presidio (Privacy Preserving Data Insights) is a toolset that includes:

Analyzer â€“ Detects PII entities in text.

Anonymizer â€“ Masks, replaces, or removes detected PII.


Use case: Masking sensitive data like names, credit cards, emails before storage or sharing.


---

ðŸ”¹ 2. Setup Environment

Option A: Use Docker (recommended for quick start)

git clone https://github.com/microsoft/presidio
cd presidio
docker-compose up

Option B: Install via pip

pip install presidio-analyzer presidio-anonymizer

> Python 3.7 or higher is required




---

ðŸ”¹ 3. Basic Usage: Detect and Anonymize Text

Step 1: Analyze

from presidio_analyzer import AnalyzerEngine

analyzer = AnalyzerEngine()
text = "My name is John and my phone is 123-456-7890"
results = analyzer.analyze(
    text=text,
    language="en"
)

for r in results:
    print(r)

What is the Result of Analyzer? (Developer View)

The result from analyze() is always a list of RecognizerResult objects.

Each item represents one detected entity (such as a name or phone number).

If no entities are found, the list is empty ([]).

Important for DevOps/Automation:
The result object has the following key properties:

entity_type: (e.g., "PERSON", "PHONE_NUMBER")

start and end: Integer indices pointing to the location in the original text.

score: Confidence score.

It does NOT include the original value; you must extract it from the text.



Example:

print(type(results))         # <class 'list'>
print(type(results[0]))      # <class 'presidio_analyzer.RecognizerResult'>
print(results)
# [
#   RecognizerResult(entity_type='PERSON', start=11, end=15, score=0.85),
#   RecognizerResult(entity_type='PHONE_NUMBER', start=32, end=44, score=0.95)
# ]

How to extract original values (critical for replacement workflows):

for r in results:
    value = text[r.start:r.end]
    print(f"Type: {r.entity_type}, Value: {value}")

Output:

Type: PERSON, Value: John
Type: PHONE_NUMBER, Value: 123-456-7890

If you need a map for later replacement (for anonymization and de-anonymization):

mappings = {f"<{r.entity_type}>": text[r.start:r.end] for r in results}

Why this matters for DevOps and Automation:

Any automated workflow that replaces or restores PII must always extract the value from the original text using start and end.

This prevents accidental mismatches, and ensures deterministic replacement and maskingâ€”essential for logs, incident reports, or audit systems.

Step 2: Anonymize

from presidio_anonymizer import AnonymizerEngine

anonymizer = AnonymizerEngine()
anonymized_text = anonymizer.anonymize(
    text=text,
    analyzer_results=results
)

print(anonymized_text.text)

Output:

"My name is <PERSON> and my phone is <PHONE_NUMBER>"


---

ðŸ”¹ 4. Customize Entities and Rules

You can add custom recognizers for domain-specific data like "Order IDs" or "Project Codes".

Use regex or ML-based recognizers.



---

ðŸ”¹ 5. Advanced Use

Use Presidio with spaCy, Stanza, or Microsoft's NER models.

Integrate into Flask/FastAPI apps.

Deploy as microservices via Docker.



---

ðŸ”¹ 6. Real-world Example

âœ… Detect and mask names, credit card numbers, emails from a user message
âœ… Send the anonymized text to an LLM
âœ… Replace the masked entities back before responding (if safe to do)


---

ðŸ”„ Replace Masked Entities Before Sending Back to User

To replace masked entities back to original PII before sending the response to the user, follow this 3-step process:


---

âœ… Goal:

1. User input â†’ You analyze and anonymize.


2. Anonymized text â†’ You send to an LLM or processing layer.


3. Response from LLM (containing placeholders) â†’ Replace placeholders with original PII â†’ Send final response to user.




---

ðŸ§  Step-by-Step Flow

Step 1: Analyze and Store Mappings

from presidio_analyzer import AnalyzerEngine

analyzer = AnalyzerEngine()
text = "My name is John and my phone number is 123-456-7890"
results = analyzer.analyze(text=text, language="en")

# Extract original entity values for mapping
mappings = {f"<{r.entity_type}>": text[r.start:r.end] for r in results}

Step 2: Anonymize

from presidio_anonymizer import AnonymizerEngine

anonymizer = AnonymizerEngine()
anonymized = anonymizer.anonymize(text=text, analyzer_results=results)

print(anonymized.text)
# e.g., "My name is <PERSON> and my phone number is <PHONE_NUMBER>"

Step 3: Get LLM Response and Replace Masked Entities

# Example LLM response
llm_response = "Thanks for contacting us, <PERSON>. We will call you at <PHONE_NUMBER>."

# Replace placeholders with original PII
for placeholder, original in mappings.items():
    llm_response = llm_response.replace(placeholder, original)

print(llm_response)
# Output: "Thanks for contacting us, John. We will call you at 123-456-7890."


---

ðŸ’¡ Tips

Use UUIDs or unique tokens (like <<PERSON_1>>) for multiple same-type entities.

Be cautious: Only re-insert original PII if your use case allows (e.g., sending it back to the same user, not logging or broadcasting).

This extraction and replacement pattern is essential for automation, chatbots, DevOps tools, and secure workflow systems.
