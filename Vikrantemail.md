Subject: Next Steps on RAG Solution API

Hello Vikrant, Anup, Vishal, and Shubham,

Thank you for the excellent demo on BM25 search, ticket resolution, document reranking, and the use of micro-MiniLM to prepare responses for ticket updates. It was very well presented.

As a next step, we need your support with the following:

We have a backlog where SMEs have added labels for repeated issues in tickets.

We want to extract SME-approved resolutions, synthesize them, and reason over them using a GenAI LLM.

The goal is to generate KB content from SME-approved tickets and train the ChromaDB-based Sentence Transformer RAG system for quick retrieval.


Request: Could you please expose your RAG solution as an API so we can integrate it into our workflow?

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Do you also want me to tighten the wording further (make it more concise for faster reading), or keep it in this detailed style?
